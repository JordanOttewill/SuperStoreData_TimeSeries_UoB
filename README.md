# SuperStoreData_TimeSeries
A project undertaken during my Masters degree. A sample dataset from Kaggle was used for time series forecasting, using python code and the XGBoost algorithm.
Libraries used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- xgboost

In the repository you will find the cody used, the analysis performed within a pdf report out and the source dataset. The visualisations in the report are a combination of python code and Tableau graphics.
